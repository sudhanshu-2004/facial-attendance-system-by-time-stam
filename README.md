# Facial Recognition Attendance System

## Introduction
This system leverages facial recognition technology to provide a secure and efficient method of marking attendance with timestamp logs. It aims to streamline the attendance process in educational or corporate settings.

## Features
- **Real-time Attendance Tracking**: Marks attendance as individuals enter the designated area.
- **Face Recognition Technology**: Utilizes advanced algorithms for accurate identification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the attendance management process.
- **Data Management**: Organizes attendance records for easy access and analysis.
- **Automatic Notifications**: Informs users when attendance is marked.

## How it Works
1. **Initialization**: Loads pre-trained facial encodings.
2. **Face Detection**: Detects faces as individuals arrive.
3. **Recognition**: Matches faces against stored encodings.
4. **Attendance Marking**: Records attendance with a timestamp upon recognition.
5. **Data Storage**: Saves attendance logs in a structured format.

## Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
